        I am a Full-stack Web Developer, who has successfully completed the Coding Boot Camp accredited and run by The University Of Birmingham. I have competently gained a highly refined industry relevant skill set to engineer a Full Stack Web Application with confidence. Whilst successfully fulfilling the requirements of this fast tracked course, I maintained my motivation to work effectively under pressure to the tightest deadlines under my own initiative, and as part of a team. Iâ€™m looking forward to transferring my hardworking passion for coding, existing skills and knowledge to contribute to the success of the right Organization.
